Write a Hadoop program to identify the 10 most frequently occurring bigrams in an 
input text corpus, along with their frequencies of occurrence. You can assume that each 
call to the Map method receives one line of the file as its input. Note that it is possible for 
a bigram to span two lines of input; you can ignore such cases and you do not have to 
count such bigrams. Also remove any punctuation marks such as “,”, “.”, “?”,"'" etc from the 
input text (this can be done in the mapper), and convert all letters to lowercase.
